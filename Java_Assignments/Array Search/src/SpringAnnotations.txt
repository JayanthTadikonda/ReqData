1.  @Controller :  		Controller is the annotation used in the spring mvc, used to implement a web page.
						Controller indicates that the particular class serves the role of a controller.
				   

				   
2.  @Service    :  		Spring @Service annotation is used with classes that provide some business functionalities.
						Spring context will autodetect these classes when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used.
				   
				   
3.  @Repositroy :  		@Repositroy annotation is used to indicate that particular class provieds implementation of databases, storage, retrieval,
						creation, updation, deletion.
					
					
4.	@Autowired  :  		The Spring framework enables automatic dependency injection. In other words, by declaring all the bean dependencies in a Spring configuration file,
						Spring container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans. This is called Spring bean autowiring.


5.  @Configuration	:	Configuration indicates that the class declares one or more @Bean methods and maybe processed by Spring container.
						 to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.
						 
						 
6.  @Bean			:   Spring @Bean Annotation is applied on a method to specify that it returns a bean to be managed by Spring context.
						Spring Bean annotation is usually declared in Configuration classes methods.
						In this case, bean methods may reference other @Bean methods in the same class by calling them directly.	
						
7.  @Resource       :   The @Resource annotation in spring performs the autowiring functionality.
						This annotation follows the autowire=byName semantics in the XML based configuration 
						i.e. it takes the name attribute for the injection.
